# Arduino External Interrupt
In this project, we want to write an interrupt-based program for the Arduino.

A tactile button is connected to PD2 (Arduino Digital Pin 2) of ATmega328p via an external pull-down resistor and an LED is connected to PB5 (Arduino Digital Pin 13).

When the button is pressed, the LED should be ON and when the button is not pressed, the LED should be OFF.

List of component:

Arduino UNO x1

Breadboard x1

Green LED x1

Pushbutton x1

Jumper wire x4

Resistor 1kÎ© x2
