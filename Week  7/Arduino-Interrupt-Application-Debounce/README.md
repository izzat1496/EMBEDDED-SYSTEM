# Arduino Interrupt Application Interrupt
In this project, we want to write an interrupt-based program for the Arduino.

When the pushbutton is pressed, the LED state will change depending on their last state. If it is LOW before, the LED will be high when the pushbutton was pressed and vice versa.

The green LED was connected to Arduino Digital Pin 3 and the pushbutton was connected to Arduino Digital Pin 2.

List of component:

Arduino UNO x1

Breadboard x1

Green LED x1

Pushbutton x1

Jumper wire x4

Resistor 1kÎ© x2
