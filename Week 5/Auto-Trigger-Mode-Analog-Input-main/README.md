# Auto-Trigger-Mode-Analog-Input
In this project, we will create a program that continuously prints out the analog value of PC3 (A3 Analog pin) through the serial port. Assuming that clock speed of Arduino at 16MHz, desired clock speed of ADC is 125kHz, using AVCC as analog reference and on-demand mode.

Then we will print the value in serial monitor when the position of the potentiometer was adjusted from 0 to 1023.

The Potentiometer will be assigned to the analog pin PC3(Analog pin A3) of Arduino UNO. The connection can be referred in the project file folder.

List of component:
