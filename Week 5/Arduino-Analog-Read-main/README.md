# Arduino-Analog-Read
In this project, we want to use Arduino UNO to prints out values from Analog input pin.

When the position of the potentiometer was adjusted, the serial monitor will print value from 0 to 1023 (according to the position of the potentiometer).

The Potentiometer will be assigned to the analog pin A0 of Arduino UNO. The connection can be referred in the project file folder.

List of component:

Arduino UNO x1

Breadboard x1

Potentiometer x1

Jumper wire x3
