# Limitation of the Prototype:

the use of the servo here is not good since need a calibration everytime it is restarted. plus they are using battery, servo used a lot of current which the servo performance affected as the battery discharge. Also , the use servo with Arduino is not good enough for maintain accuracy and precision when dealing with servo.

The usage of battery here is not effecient because of motor using a lot of current, the playing time will be limited and short.

the use oof USB connection here is a hassle and tidious.



# Improvement can be made:
 
instead on using servo, better to use 5V push and pull selonoid electromagnetic which cost around the same as the TowerPro sg90 micro servo.

need a direct power supply instead of battery to maintain performance.

the connection can be improved by using wireless connection like HC-05 bluetooth (RM12 x3) but it will also require additional microcontroller ( Arduino Pro Mini RM10 x 2)
