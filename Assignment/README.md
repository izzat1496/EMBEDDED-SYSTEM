# Limitation of the Prototype:

the use of the servo here is not good since need a calibration everytime it is restarted. plus they are using battery, servo used a lot of current which the servo performance affected as the battery discharge.

The usage of battery here is not effecient because of motor using a lot of current, the playing time will be limited here.



# Improvement can be made:
 
instead on using servo, better to use 5V push and pull selonoid electromagnetic.

need a direct power supply instead of battery to maintain performance.
