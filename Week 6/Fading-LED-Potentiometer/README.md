# Application control Fading LED using potentiometer
In this project we want to control the timer port of Arduino.

This program is to apply the timer port Arduino. We will use potentiometer value to do fading LED.

The LED will be connected to pin 6 of Arduino which have PWM control. Meanwhile the potentiometer was connected to analog pin A0 of the Arduino.

List of component:

Arduino UNO x1

Breadboard x1

Green LED x1

Jumper wire x6

Potentiometer x1

Resistor 1kÎ© x 1
