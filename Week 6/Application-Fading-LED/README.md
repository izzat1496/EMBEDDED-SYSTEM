# Application Fading LED
In this project we want to control the timer port of Arduino.

This program is to apply the timer port Arduino. We will use PWM to do fading LED.

The LED will be connected to pin 6 of Arduino which have PWN control.

List of component:

Arduino UNO x1

Breadboard x1

Green LED x1

Jumper wire x2
