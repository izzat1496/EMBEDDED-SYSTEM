# Arduino-Pushbutton
In this project, I will use Arduino needs to keep track of how many times each of 3 switch has been pressed.

There are 3 switches (A,B and C). When any of this switch was pressed, Arduino need to send out the information through the serial port.

Switch A will be assigned to pin 10, switch B will be assign to pin 9 and switch C will be assigned to pin 8.

List of component:

Arduino UNO x1

Breadboard x1

330Î© Resistor x3

Red LED x3

Pushbutton x3

Jumper wire x5
