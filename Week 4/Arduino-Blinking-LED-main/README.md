# Arduino-Blinking-LED
In this project, we will use arduino to control the blink of 2 LED with different ON and OFF time.

The yellow LED will be flashing with ON time of 750ms and OFF time of 350ms. Then, the red LED will be flashing needs to be flashing with ON time of 400ms and OFF time of 600ms.

Yellow LED will be assigned to Arduino pin 8 and Red LED will be assigned to Arduino pin 9.
